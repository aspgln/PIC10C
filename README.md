## Assignment 1
This assignment is to write a single-player version of the card game known as 'siete y medio' (seven and a half), which is a [spanish playing card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_playing_cards) that is very similar in nature to the casino game of Blackjack (also known as 21). The goal of the game is to get cards whose total value comes the closest to 7&frac12;	without going over it. Getting a card total over 7&frac12; is called "busting".
